The acting from Pattinson and Dafoe is sublime, with Dafoe giving one of the best monologues in cinema history. Watch two men descend into madness as they are overtaken by the solemn embrace of a godforsaken rock."

        "review": "Austin Butler saves what is otherwise an unwatchable movie. Hyper-stylized, ultra-fast paced, very long, and does very little for character development. Complete overstimulation, and all narrated by one of the worst accents I have ever heard. It's one of those movies you think you've been watching for over an hour but it's only been twenty-five minutes. And it's nearly three hours long."

        "review": "A masterclass in WWII storytelling. The sense of dread and the largely unspoken struggle for survival is completely engrossing as a viewer. Watch this without distractions and sit with the idea that 400,000 real soldiers stood at Dunkirk without any known esacape as axis powers closed in. Chilling, and amazing."

Exploring the perverse desires of both the elite and in the midst of our own bedrooms, this film delivers one of the most bizarre and compelling scenes ever with 'the party'. Kidman stands out in her deviant delivery of Alice, and the antagonist known only as 'Red Cape' will live in your memory."

Though generally slower than your avergae mob movie, it feels comfortably paced, taking time to reflect on diasporic dynamics of Russian immigrants in America. Viggo Mortensen is a star in this role as well, absolutely deserved an Oscar."

        "review": "What more can be said about this classic Miyazaki film? Fantastic, absurd, sweet, and incomporably animated. Even the wicked witch's grotesque features are animated in a way only Ghibli can. Sophie's character gives us insight into the changes we incur as we age, Calcifer reminds us to keep our passions burning, and Howl reminds us to hold onto youthful idealism. Wonderful movie."

If you can get through that, Eggers delivers a great full-circle hero bent on vengeance story. Incorporating old Viking religion and feudal slave/master dynamics, this is a no holds barred approach to ancient Nordic storytelling."

Though Freddie may not be the most overwhelming physical villain, his grotesque face and creepy aesthetic while haunting dreams will put anyone on edge. It's also fun to see an early Johnny Depp, and the death scenes must have been groundbreaking for their time."

MAL was soloing unfathomably dangerous climbs, not for clout, but for the true connection with nature. The man lived a short time, but it was to serve a specific purpose. It's easy to be inspired by someone so singularly driven in life. Prepare to have your jaw on the floor with some of these camera shots."

With obvious overtures to Scientology, this movie is biting yet compassionate to all the characters and their personal weaknesses"

Showing the rise and fall of an antisocial narcissist devoid of fear and hungry for power, this movie shows humanity at its utmost corruptible. Pacino is enthralling, and the backdrop of 1980's Miami at the height of the cocaine trade creates an environment within an organized crime movie unlike any other."
