The acting from Pattinson and Dafoe is sublime, with Dafoe giving one of the best monologues in cinema history. Watch two men descend into madness as they are overtaken by the solemn embrace of a godforsaken rock."

        "review": "Austin Butler saves what is otherwise an unwatchable movie. Hyper-stylized, ultra-fast paced, very long, and does very little for character development. Complete overstimulation, and all narrated by one of the worst accents I have ever heard. It's one of those movies you think you've been watching for over an hour but it's only been twenty-five minutes. And it's nearly three hours long."

Watch this without distractions and sit with the idea that 400,000 real soldiers stood at Dunkirk without any known esacape as axis powers closed in. Chilling, and amazing."

Exploring the perverse desires of both the elite and in the midst of our own bedrooms, this film delivers one of the most bizarre and compelling scenes ever with 'the party'. Kidman stands out in her deviant delivery of Alice, and the antagonist known only as 'Red Cape' will live in your memory."

Though generally slower than your avergae mob movie, it feels comfortably paced, taking time to reflect on diasporic dynamics of Russian immigrants in America. Viggo Mortensen is a star in this role as well, absolutely deserved an Oscar."

Even the wicked witch's grotesque features are animated in a way only Ghibli can. Sophie's character gives us insight into the changes we incur as we age, Calcifer reminds us to keep our passions burning, and Howl reminds us to hold onto youthful idealism. Wonderful movie."

If you can get through that, Eggers delivers a great full-circle hero bent on vengeance story. Incorporating old Viking religion and feudal slave/master dynamics, this is a no holds barred approach to ancient Nordic storytelling."

Though Freddie may not be the most overwhelming physical villain, his grotesque face and creepy aesthetic while haunting dreams will put anyone on edge. It's also fun to see an early Johnny Depp, and the death scenes must have been groundbreaking for their time."

MAL was soloing unfathomably dangerous climbs, not for clout, but for the true connection with nature. The man lived a short time, but it was to serve a specific purpose. It's easy to be inspired by someone so singularly driven in life. Prepare to have your jaw on the floor with some of these camera shots."

HAL's voice will linger in my head forever, as will the last third of this movie, which should be only known through an actual viewing rather than being described here."

Joaquin Phoenix and PSH are perfect together in this dynamic, and PSH delivers as a deluded, narcissistic cult leader who has created his own reality around him. With obvious overtures to Scientology, this movie is biting yet compassionate to all the characters and their personal weaknesses"
